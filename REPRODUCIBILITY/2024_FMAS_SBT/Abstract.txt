Abstract

Summary
The artifact installs and runs BehaVerify, the tool that is presented in the paper. The artifact is capable of reproducing all results produced by BehaVerify in the paper and provides details on how to install BehaVerify, run the tests, and details regarding graphs. An unfortunate limitation is that the tool we compare to cannot be run via the command line, so the artifacts ability to reproduce some of the results is limited.

Documentation
See README.md.

Additional Requirements
--Via Docker
---The ability to run python3.
---The ability to install docker py using pip.
