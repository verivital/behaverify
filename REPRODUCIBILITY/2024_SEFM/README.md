This README is meant to provide information about reproducing results used in SEFM 2024. However, it can also be used as a more general installation guide for BehaVerify, though eventually it may be inadequate for this purpose as it will not be updated along with BehaVerify, in order to ensure it remains useful for its primary purpose, reproduction of results for SEFM 2024.

See version\_info.txt for information about dependency requirements.

# Prerequisites and Information

1. docker with the ability to run commands as a regular user (see https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/ ). Additionally, we will be using Ubuntu 22.04 inside docker. Some users appear to have issues with running commands like update or upgrade in docker when using Ubuntu 22.04; we do not have a workaround for this.
2. nuXmv (see  https://nuxmv.fbk.eu/download.html or https://nuxmv.fbk.eu/theme/download.php?file=nuXmv-2.0.0-linux64.tar.gz ). You only need to download nuXmv. There should be no installation. Please ensure you download the Linux 64-bit x86 version 2.0.0 (October 14, 2019). The executable will be located in **nuXmv-2.0.0-linux64/nuXmv-2.0.0-Linux/bin/nuXmv**. There should be **NO FILE EXTENSION**.
3. If you choose to use Docker, we assume you have access to Python3. If you choose to run locally, we assume you are able to run bash scripts. These have **only been tested on Ubuntu**. If you cannot run the scripts, please run the commands present in the bash scripts manually. Note that this will require arguments to replaced. Specifically, $1 means the first argument provided to the bash script, $2 means the second argument provided to the bash script, etc.

Note, we require docker py for use with python3 if using docker. It can be installed using

	pip install docker

## nuXmv

Per the licensing agreement of nuXmv (see https://nuxmv.fbk.eu/downloads/LICENSE.txt ), we may not re-distribute the software in any form for any purpose. As such, while we appreciate that downloading nuXmv separately is tedious and means that this artifact is somewhat incomplete, we do not have any alternative available to us. Thank you for understanding.


# Test Information

1. The Install Test is mostly to test installation. It is very fast.
2. The Partial Test is very fast. It produces all the BehaVerify results for Bigger Fish and Simple Robot. It does not run the ISR example. The comparison to MoVe4BT requires manually installing MoVe4BT and running the files individually. However, we do provide the XML files used to load the experiments we used.
3. The Full test replicates all results for BehaVerify. The comparison to MoVe4BT requires manually installing MoVe4BT and running the files individually. However, we do provide the XML files used to load the experiments we used.
4. The results in the paper were generated using a Dell Inc. OptiPlex 7040 with 64 GiB of Memory with an Intel i7â€“6700 CPU @ 3.40GHz with 8 cores.
5. We have confirmed that an old Chromebook using the Linux development environment is capable of running all the tests. The install and partial tests complete fairly quickly, but the full test is rather slow. Obviously, your machines capabilities will change the exact numbers. The point, however, is that you do not need a powerful machine to run these tests.

---

# Running Tests With Docker

The tests can be run using docker. We provide several methods for doing this. Some utilize a prebuilt docker image, while others rebuild the image. If this is part of an artifact evaluation, we will provide a docker image.

## Single Script Options

- Build Scripts -> These scripts use the Dockerfile to build a new image and then create a container.
- Load Scripts -> These scripts load the provided image and then create a container.

We provide 3 scripts of each type (1 for each test from Test Information). Each of these scripts takes four command line arguments, three of which are the same.
	
- **/path/to/Dockerfile/Folder/** -> This should point to the folder containing the Dockerfile.
- **/path/to/DockerImage** -> This should point to  the Dockerimage.
- **/path/to/nuXmv** -> This should point to the executable you downloaded as a prerequisite. There should be no file extension.
- **mode** -> Required, sort of. This should be **install**, **partial**, or **full**. 
- **/path/to/output** -> The output will be copied to /path/to/output.tar. This will not override existing files, so make sure there is no existing file.

### Single Script: Minimal (estimated time: 3 minutes. 6 minutes on Chromebook)

Build Script:

	python3 build_and_run.py /path/to/Dockerfile/Folder/ /path/to/nuXmv install /path/to/output

Load Script:

	python3 load_and_run.py /path/to/DockerImage /path/to/nuXmv install /path/to/output
	
The results will be written in **/path/to/output.tar**. Extract the archive and see the Interpreting and Comparing Results section for more information.

### Single Script: Partial (estimated time: 8 minutes. 40 minutes on Chromebook)

Build Script:

	python3 build_and_run.py /path/to/Dockerfile/Folder/ /path/to/nuXmv partial /path/to/output

Load Script:

	python3 load_and_run.py /path/to/DockerImage /path/to/nuXmv partial /path/to/output
	
The results will be written in **/path/to/output.tar**. Extract the archive and see the Interpreting and Comparing Results section for more information.

### Single Script: Full (estimated time: 16 minutes. 1 hour on Chromebook)

Build Script:

	python3 build_and_run.py /path/to/Dockerfile/Folder/ /path/to/nuXmv full /path/to/output

Load Script:

	python3 load_and_run.py /path/to/DockerImage /path/to/nuXmv full /path/to/output
	
The results will be written in **/path/to/output.tar**. Extract the archive and see the Interpreting and Comparing Results section for more information.

---

## Step by Step Docker instructions

This section will explain how to utilize either the provided docker image or Dockerfile to recreate the tests using docker.

### 1a. Creation of the Docker Image and Container (estimated time: 1 minutes. 5 minutes on Chromebook )

You only need to execute 1a or 1b. See 1b for steps using the image. However, should you wish to build the docker image yourself, please run

	python3 reinstall.py /path/to/Dockerfile/folder

This will create a docker image named behaverify\_img with the tag latest. It will then also create a container named behaverify from that image.

### 1b. Using the provided Docker Image to create a Container (estimated time: ??)

You only need to execute 1a or 1b. See 1a for steps using the Dockerfile. However, should you wish to load a prebuilt image yourself, please run

	python3 load_image.py /path/to/Dockerimage

This will create a docker image named behaverify\_img with the tag latest. It will then also create a container named behaverify from that image.

### IMPORTANT:
The scripts below assume that the docker container is named behaverify. If you run 1a or 1b, this will be handled for you, and you need not worry.

### 2. Addition of nuXmv (estimated time: 30 seconds)

Next, please run

	python3 add_nuxmv.py /path/to/nuXmv

This will copy nuXmv from the path you provided to the correct location in the docker and ensure it is runable and an executable. Note that you should not point to the folder containing nuXmv, but to nuXmv itself, and that the nuXmv version should be the Linux version.

### 3. Install Test (estimated time: 30 seconds. 1 minute on Chromebook)

The full test takes quite a while to run. To ensure everything works right, please run

	python3 generate.py install /path/to/output

### 4. Partial Test (estimated time: 1 minute. 35 minutes on Chromebook)

The full test takes quite a while to run. To ensure everything works right, please run

	python3 generate.py partial /path/to/output

### 5. Full Results (estimated time: 15 minutes. 1 hour on Chromebook)

	python3 generate.py full /path/to/output

# Verbose Installation for Running tests locally without docker.

The instructions are for Linux (and more specifically Ubuntu). We have not tested this on any other systems. Some of the scripts are likely to break on other systems. For instance, the scripts assume that nuXmv will be named nuXmv, and not nuXmv.exe. However, our code itself should still work (though we have not tested this).

This section is intentionally lengthy. If you are not interested in the details and just want the commands, please scroll down further


1. nuXmv<br />Please download nuXmv (see  https://nuxmv.fbk.eu/ ). You only need to download nuXmv. There should be no installation. Download the relevant version for your system. It should be version 2.0.0. The download will include many files. You only need the executable (no file extension). See above for more information.
2. Updating<br /> We suggest running the following commands.

		sudo apt update
		sudo apt upgrade
3. Python3<br />Python3 is used to run BehaVerify. As such, it is necessary. If you already have python3 installed, skip the following step. If not, run

		sudo apt install python3
4. pip<br />pip is used to install other python packages. If you already have pip installed (for python3), skip the following step. If not, run

		sudo apt install pip
5. PyTrees<br />PyTrees is used in the generated python code. It is necessary for the differential testing experiments, or for using generated python code in general.

		python3 -m pip install py_trees

# Running Tests Locally without docker (requires installation, see above).

Note that each script will erase all the relevant results before running, to ensure that the results which exist after the script runs are accurate to that script. Thus if you wish to save the results, please move them before running another script.

## Minimal Script

To test everything is working, please navigate to behaverify/REPRODUCIBILITY/2024\_SEFM/ and run the following

	./behaverify_nfm_install_test.sh ./

This will run a fairly small script. The results will be in behaverify/REPRODUCIBILITY/2024\_SEFM/examples/. Please see the Interpreting and Comparing Results section for an explanation of what results to look for.

## Partial Script

To create a subset of the results, please navigate to behaverify/REPRODUCIBILITY/2024\_SEFM/ and run the following

	./behaverify_nfm_partial_results.sh ./

This will run a larger, but still fairly small script. The results will be in behaverify/REPRODUCIBILITY/2024\_SEFM/examples/. Please see the Interpreting and Comparing Results section for an explanation of what results to look for.

## Full Script

To create all results, please navigate to behaverify/REPRODUCIBILITY/2024\_SEFM/ and run the following

	./behaverify_nfm_full_results.sh ./

This will run a large script. The results will be in **behaverify/REPRODUCIBILITY/2024\_SEFM/examples/**. Please see the Interpreting and Comparing Results section for an explanation of what results to look for.

# MoVe4BT Information

Our SEFM paper compared to MoVe4BT. See https://move4bt.github.io/ . We found that installing the tool using the instruction at https://move4bt.github.io/manual was fairly painless, but your experience may vary. Unfortunately, we did not find a way to run the tool from the command-line, so we cannot automate the process in Docker.

1. After following those instructions and launching MoVe4BT, please press the editor button.
2. Then click Load Tree on the left side of the GUI.
3. Please Load an xml file from **/behaverify/REPRODUCIBILITY/2024\_SEFM/MoVe4BT\_XML\_Files/xml/**.
4. The file may take a while to load, especially for the bigger examples.
5. Click verifications.
6. The GUI may freeze. Feel free to ignore the wait/force quit option, or repeatedly click wait. Eventually, it will print results, or produce a blank screen.

The code for generating the files is in **/behaverify/REPRODUCIBILITY/2024\_SEFM/examples/bigger\_fish/create\_bigger\_fish\_MoVe4BT\_xml.py**. Run using the following command

```
python3 create_bigger_fish_MoVe4BT_xml.py /path/to/output/location min max step
```

Where the path is where the files will be outputted (must be a folder, do not include final slash), min is the smallest size file to generate, max is the largest (inclusive) and step is the step size. Therefore, the command used to generate the used xml files is

```
python3 create_bigger_fish_MoVe4BT_xml.py /path/to/output/location 50 1000 50
```

There is a similar simple robot file.

**ADDITIONALLY**, we provide a .sh script in **/behaverify/REPRODUCIBILTY/2024\_SEFM/MoVe4BT/install\_MoVe4BT.sh** for instlal MoVe4BT. It is possible to run MoVe4BT through docker webtop, but this is not something we were able to automate.

---

# Interpreting and Comparing Results

Upon completing any of the test scripts, you should find that /path/to/writable/location/ has a folder containing the results. The name of this folder depends on which test was run. See the specific tests for details. Within this folder, you should find the following folders, each of which corresponds to an experiment:

- bigger\_fish -> This is the Bigger Fish experiment. See **Section 7.1**.
- ISR -> This is the ISR experiment. See **Section 4.4** and **Section 7.3**.
- simple\_robot -> This experiment is the Simple Robot experiment. See **Section 7.2**.
- clean_all.sh -> This is a script for removing results. Ignore it.

## Install Test

The install test can only be used to confirm the installation worked.

### What to look for

As mentioned, you will not be able to find anything to compare. However, please confirm that the following files exist:

- **bigger\_fish/processed\_data/pictures/bigger\_fish/bigger\_fish_ltl.png** -> This will have 4 lines with 2 data points, representing the performance of the various optimizations.
- **simple\_robot/processed\_data/pictures/simple\_robot\_ltl.png**

## Partial Test

The partial test is between the install and full test. Some, but not all, of the results in the paper are generated through this test.

The results should be in **/path/to/output/extracted/examples/**.

### What to look for

- **bigger\_fish/processed\_data/pictures/full\_opt/bigger\_fish\_ltl.png** -> This will have some of the timing results for BehaVerify used for the Bigger Fish experiment. See **Section 7.1**, **Figure 5**. Note that this does **not** include the timing results for MoVe4BT. As such, the scale may look different. Please try to compare actual numbers rather than the shape of the graph. This is a timing experiment, so the results may differ somewhat.
- **simple\_robot/processed\_data/pictures/simple\_robot\_ltl.png** -> This will have some of the timing results for BehaVerivy used for Simple Robot experiment. See **Section 7.2**, **Figure 7**. Note that this graph does **not** include the timing results for MoVe4BT. As such, the scale may look different. Please try to compare actual numbers rather than the shape of the graph. This is a timing experiment, so the results may differ somewhat.

## Full Test

The Full test generates all the results used in the paper.

The results should be in **/path/to/output/extracted/examples/**.

### What to look for


- **bigger\_fish/processed\_data/pictures/full\_opt/bigger\_fish\_ltl.png** -> This will have all of the timing results for BehaVerify used for the Bigger Fish experiment. See **Section 7.1**, **Figure 5**. Note that this does **not** include the timing results for MoVe4BT. As such, the scale may look different. Please try to compare actual numbers rather than the shape of the graph. This is a timing experiment, so the results may differ somewhat.
- **ISR/processed\_data/pictures/counterexample\_for\_5/11x11\_line.png** -> This should correspond to **Section 7.3**, **Figure 8**.
- **simple\_robot/processed\_data/pictures/simple\_robot\_ltl.png** -> This will have all of the timing results for BehaVerivy used for Simple Robot experiment. See **Section 7.2**, **Figure 7**. Note that this graph does **not** include the timing results for MoVe4BT. As such, the scale may look different. Please try to compare actual numbers rather than the shape of the graph. This is a timing experiment, so the results may differ somewhat.

# Potential Errors and Workarounds

1. If a script fails because permission has been denied, please run the script without sudo (running docker without sudo requires some configuration). If the problem persists, please try a different location, as occasionally docker cannot write to secondary disks.
2. If building from the Dockerfile fails, please try and use the load option instead.
3. If building from the Dockerfile fails and the load option is not available, please consider running **clean\_docker.sh**. THIS WILL REMOVE ALL EXISTING DOCKER CONTAINERS AND IMAGES. For some reason, this sometimes seems to help.
4. If everything runs to completion, but there are no images in the copied directory, please confirm if there are files in the results folders (e.g., **bigger\_fish\_selector/results/**). If there are, then most likely you encountered errors similar to the following during execution:
   ```
   OpenBLAS blas_thread_init: pthread_create failed for thread 1 of 16: Operation not permitted
   ```
   Note that this error would not prevent the scripts from completing; it would only prevent the generation of graphs and tables. The internet suggests upgrading your docker version (we tested using docker version 20.10.24, build 297e128). Alternatively, you may by manually compile the results into graphs by calling the scripts at https://github.com/verivital/behaverify/tree/main/REPRODUCIBILITY/2024_SEFM/scripts/process_results_scripts . These scripts assume they are being run in the repository folder structure.
