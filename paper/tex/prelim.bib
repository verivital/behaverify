abstract="Hyperproperties are properties of sets of computation traces. In this paper, we study quantitative hyperproperties, which we define as hyperproperties that express a bound on the number of traces that may appear in a certain relation. For example, quantitative non-interference limits the amount of information about certain secret inputs that is leaked through the observable outputs of a system. Quantitative non-interference thus bounds the number of traces that have the same observable input but different observable output. We study quantitative hyperproperties in the setting of HyperLTL, a temporal logic for hyperproperties. We show that, while quantitative hyperproperties can be expressed in HyperLTL, the running time of the HyperLTL model checking algorithm is, depending on the type of property, exponential or even doubly exponential in the quantitative bound. We improve this complexity with a new model checking algorithm based on model-counting. The new algorithm needs only logarithmic space in the bound and therefore improves, depending on the property, exponentially or even doubly exponentially over the model checking algorithm of HyperLTL. In the worst case, the new algorithm needs polynomial space in the size of the system. Our Max{\#}Sat-based prototype implementation demonstrates, however, that the counting approach is viable on systems with nontrivial quantitative information flow requirements such as a passcode checker.",

abstract="We introduce EAHyper, the first tool for the automatic checking of satisfiability, implication, and equivalence of hyperproperties. Hyperproperties are system properties that relate multiple computation traces. A typical example is an information flow policy that compares the observations made by an external observer on execution traces that result from different values of a secret variable. EAHyper analyzes hyperproperties that are specified in HyperLTL, a recently introduced extension of linear-time temporal logic (LTL). HyperLTL uses trace variables and trace quantifiers to refer to multiple execution traces simultaneously. Applications of EAHyper include the automatic detection of specifications that are inconsistent or vacuously true, as well as the comparison of multiple formalizations of the same policy, such as different notions of observational determinism.",

abstract="Verifying hyperproperties at runtime is a challenging problem as hyperproperties, such as non-interference and observational determinism, relate multiple computation traces with each other. It is necessary to store previously seen traces, because every new incoming trace needs to be compatible with every run of the system observed so far. Furthermore, the new incoming trace poses requirements on future traces. In our monitoring approach, we focus on those requirements by rewriting a hyperproperty in the temporal logic HyperLTL to a Boolean constraint system. A hyperproperty is then violated by multiple runs of the system if the constraint system becomes unsatisfiable. We compare our implementation, which utilizes either BDDs or a SAT solver to store and evaluate constraints, to the automata-based monitoring tool RVHyper.",

abstract="In this paper, we propose a new temporal logic for expressing and reasoning about probabilistic hyperproperties. Hyperproperties characterize the relation between different independent executions of a system. Probabilistic hyperproperties express quantitative dependencies between such executions. The standard temporal logics for probabilistic systems, i.e., PCTL and PCTL can refer only to a single path at a time and, hence, cannot express many probabilistic hyperproperties of interest. The logic proposed in this paper, HyperPCTL, adds explicit and simultaneous quantification over multiple traces to PCTL. Such quantification allows expressing probabilistic hyperproperties. A model checking algorithm for the proposed logic is also introduced for discrete-time Markov chains.",

abstract="Hyperproperties are becoming the, de facto, standard for reasoning about systems executions. They differ from classical trace properties since they are represented by sets of sets of executions instead of sets of executions. In this paper, we extend and lift the hierarchy of semantics developed in 2002 by P. Cousot in order to cope with verification of hyperproperties. In the standard hierarchy, semantics at different levels of abstraction are related with each other by abstract interpretation. In the same spirit, we propose an hyperhierarchy of semantics adding a new, more concrete, hyper level. The semantics defined at this hyper level are suitable for hyperproperties verification. Furthermore, all the semantics in the hyperhierarchy (the standard and the hyper ones) are still related by abstract interpretation.",

abstract="HyperLTL is an extension of linear-time temporal logic for the specification of hyperproperties, i.e., temporal properties that relate multiple computation traces. HyperLTL can express information flow policies as well as properties like symmetry in mutual exclusion algorithms or Hamming distances in error-resistant transmission protocols. Previous work on HyperLTL model checking has focussed on the alternation-free fragment of HyperLTL, where verification reduces to checking a standard trace property over an appropriate self-composition of the system. The alternation-free fragment does, however, not cover general hyperliveness properties. Universal formulas, for example, cannot express the secrecy requirement that for every possible value of a secret variable there exists a computation where the value is different while the observations made by the external observer are the same. In this paper, we study the more difficult case of hyperliveness properties expressed as HyperLTL formulas with quantifier alternation. We reduce existential quantification to strategic choice and show that synthesis algorithms can be used to eliminate the existential quantifiers automatically. We furthermore show that this approach can be extended to reactive system synthesis, i.e., to automatically construct a reactive system that is guaranteed to satisfy a given HyperLTL formula.",

abstract="We address the problem of verifying k-safety properties: properties that refer to k interacting executions of a program. A prominent way to verify k-safety properties is by self composition. In this approach, the problem of checking k-safety over the original program is reduced to checking an ``ordinary'' safety property over a program that executes k copies of the original program in some order. The way in which the copies are composed determines how complicated it is to verify the composed program. We view this composition as provided by a semantic self composition function that maps each state of the composed program to the copies that make a move.  Since the ``quality'' of a self composition function is measured by the ability to verify the safety of the composed program, we formulate the problem of inferring a self composition function together with the inductive invariant needed to verify safety of the composed program, where both are restricted to a given language. We develop a property-directed inference algorithm that, given a set of predicates, infers composition-invariant pairs expressed by Boolean combinations of the given predicates, or determines that no such pair exists. We implemented our algorithm and demonstrate that it is able to find self compositions that are beyond reach of existing tools.",

We propose an algorithm based on a counterexample-guided refinement loop that simultaneously searches for a reduction and a proof of the correctness for the reduction.

We propose to exploit relational specifications for simplifying the generated verification subtasks. First, we maximize opportunities for synchronizing code fragments. Second, we compute symmetries in the specifications to reveal and avoid redundant subtasks. We have implemented these enhancements in a prototype for verifying k-safety properties on Java programs.

abstract="Cyber-physical systems are processing large amounts of sensitive information, but are increasingly often becoming the target of cyber attacks. Thus, it is essential to verify the absence of unauthorized information flow at design time before the systems get deployed. Our paper addresses this problem by proposing a novel approach to model-check the information flow security of cyber-physical systems represented by timed automata. We describe the transformation into so-called test automata, reducing the verification to a reachability test that is carried out using the off-the-shelf model checker Uppaal. Opposed to related work, we analyze the real-time behavior of systems, allowing software engineers to precisely identify timing channels that would enable attackers to draw conclusions from the system's response times. We illustrate the approach by detecting a timing channel in a simplified model of a cyber-manufacturing system.",

abstract="Temporal logics such as LTL are often used to express safety or correctness properties of programs. However, they cannot model complex formulas known as hyperproperties introducing relations between different execution paths of a same system. In order to do so, the logic HyperLTL adds existential and universal quantifications of path variables to LTL. The model-checking problem, that is, determining if a given representation of a program verifies a HyperLTL property, has been shown to be decidable for finite state systems. In this paper, we prove that this result does not hold for Pushdown Systems nor for the subclass of Visibly Pushdown Systems. We therefore introduce an algorithm that over-approximates the model-checking problem with an automata-theoretic approach. We also detail an under-approximation method based on a phase-bounded analysis of Multi-Stack Pushdown Systems. We then show how these approximations can be used to check security policies.",
