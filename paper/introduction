Behavior Trees are a framework for describing the execution of a task. This includes sequences, which allow actions to be ordered, selectors, which allow priorities to be set, and other control flow options. While they originated in video games, they have since gained traction within the robotics community. Behavior Trees are split into composite, or internal, nodes and leaf, or external, nodes. Composite nodes control general tree traversal while leaf nodes consist of guard conditions and actions for the tree to execute. While the leaf nodes are frequently customized, the composite nodes are generally used out of the box. BehaVerify is a tool that leverages this to automatically create a model which only requires additional user customization for specialized leaf nodes. The model can be verified using nuXmv.
