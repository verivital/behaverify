--uh....idk tbh. this one is obviously just false

--a counter example should be found, proving that if low warning state occurs, eventually active_node=7, meaning we triggered surface_task. takes 80 steps for this to occur though.

--a counter example should be found, proving that the low warning state can occur. takes until step 74 for this to happen though. lmao. oh god.

--the above is actually just straight forward trying to prove that if we hit low battery, we eventually hit active_node=7 (surface task)
