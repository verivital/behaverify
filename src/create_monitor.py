def create_ltl2ba_command(specification):
    # what do I want this to return?
    # obviously I need it to return the command that we will feed to ltl2ba, but I also need more than that.
    # the other thing this needs to return is a dictionary from atoms (p1, p2, etc) to their definitions (e.g., p1 = x < 4).
    # then I just need to feed the ltl command to ltl2ba, and then parse that ouput using another method.
