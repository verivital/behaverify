need to update all version to more properly reset (they currently reset when we reach the root/self and status =success | failure, but it should actually be whenever any ancestor does that).

need to implement new version that 'jumps' to next leaf always. allows deletion of previous_node, previous_status. allow non-determinism of status via a passed status variable.
basically, the same we currently point to a child, we will point to a parent which will redirect us through the tree.
nodes won't have to track descendants, because status automatically propegates upwards.
