# BehaVerify

BehaVerify is a tool for turning specifications of Behavior Trees into nuXmv models for verification as well as generating Python and Haskell implementations of the specified trees.

To recreate tests, see REPRODUCIBILITY.

Older versions can be found in subfolders of /src/versions/. The documentation for older versions may not be accurate.

It should be version 2.0.0. The download will include many files. You only need the executable (no file extension). See above for more information. You only need to execute this step if you are interested in verifying the generated models with nuXmv.
2. Updating<br /> We suggest running the following commands.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

# Running BehaVerify Locally

This section will be structured as follows

- General Layout and Information
- Generating .smv files for nuXmv
- Generating .py files for Python
- Generating .hs files for Haskell

---

## General Layout and Information

File extensions are not mandatory. This documentation will use the following convention for them

- .smv -> a file for use with nuXmv
- .tree -> a specification file that follows the rules in behaverify/metamodel/behaverify.tx (a textx file)
- .tx -> a metamodel file.
- .py -> a Python file (either generated by BehaVerify, or a source file for BehaVerify)
- .hs -> a Haskell file (generated by BehaVerify)

The following files are relevant to the user. They assume they are in the in behaverify/src and may not work correctly if moved or if other files are missing from that directory.

- dsl\_to\_nuxmv.py -> Converts .tree files to .smv files
- dsl\_to\_haskell.py -> Converts .tree files to Haskell
- dsl\_to\_python.py -> Converts .tree files to Python (py\_trees)

---

## Generating .smv files for nuXmv

.smv files can be used with nuXmv for model verification. You can generate .smv using the following command:

```
python3 ./src/dsl_to_behaverify.py ./metamodel/behaverify.tx /path/to/tree.tree /path/to/smv.smv
```

We assume you are running this command from the top level of the repository. If not, please adjust paths as necessary.

### Arguments

- ./metamodel/behaverify.tx -> this argument must point to the metamodel file.
- /path/to/tree.tree -> this argument must point to a specification file. It does not need to have the .tree extension.
- /path/to/smv.smv -> the output will be written to the file location provided. You do not need to make this a .smv file.

### Additional Optional Arguments

Additional arguments are listed below. You must preface them with --

- --keep\_stage\_0 -> Flag option (no additional information required). This disables the stage\_0 pruning optimization. 
- --keep\_last\_stage -> Flag option (no additional information required). This disables the last\_stage pruning optimization. 
- --do\_not\_trim -> Flag option (no additional information required). This disables node pruning. BehaVerify will not restructure your tree to remove unreachable nodes.

### Using nuXmv for verification

Please run the following command

```
/path/to/nuXmv --int /path/to/smv.smv
```

Here --int will turn this into interactive mode. Now, run the following commands

```
go
check_ctlspec
check_ltlspec
check_invar
quit
```

go is a command which runs several commands in preparation of model checking. The check commands check the relevant specifications. If a specification is False, a counterexample will be produced.

---

## Generating Python Files

Python files can be generated using the following command:

```
python3 ./src/dsl_to_pytree.py ./metamodel/behaverify.tx /path/to/tree.tree /path/to/output/folder/ fileName 
```

We assume you are running this command from the top level of the repository. If not, please adjust paths as necessary.

### Arguments

- ./metamodel/behaverify.tx -> this argument must point to the metamodel file.
- /path/to/tree.tree -> this argument must point to a specification file. It does not need to have the .tree extension.
- /path/to/output/folder/ -> this argument must point to a folder. This is where the python files will be written.
- fileName -> this should not include any extension. fileName.py, fileName\_environment.py, and fileName\_runner.py will depend upon this name.

Note that various other files will also be created.

### Additional Optional Arguments

Additional arguments are listed below. You must preface them with --

- --max\_iter -> Requires an integer. Defaults to 100. This dictates how many iterations fileName\_runner.py will execute.
- --no\_var\_print -> Flag option (no additional information required). This disables the printing of variables.
- --serene\_print -> Flag option (no additional information required). This enables the printing of the status of the tree after each tick.
- --py\_tree\_print -> Flag option (no additional information required). This enables the use of PyTree visualizers to print information about the status of the tree (warning: this does not reflect the status the nodes returned when running, as those nodes are sometimes reset).


### Utilizing the Generated Files

Run

```
python3 /path/to/folder/fileName_runner.py
```
	
---

## Generating Haskell Files

Haskell Files are slightly more irritating to generate and use. First, create a folder where you wish to store your Haskell files. Then use the following command

```
mkdir /path/to/output/folder
mkdir /path/to/output/folder/app
```

This will cause cabal to initiate a project in the current folder. Next, run  the following command:

```
python ./src/dsl_to_pytree.py ./metamodel/behaverify.tx /path/to/tree.tree /path/to/output/folder/ fileName 
```

We assume you are running this command from the top level of the repository. If not, please adjust paths as necessary.

### Arguments

- ./metamodel/behaverify.tx -> this argument must point to the metamodel file.
- /path/to/tree.tree -> this argument must point to a specification file. It does not need to have the .tree extension.
- /path/to/output/folder/ -> this argument must point to a folder. The haskell files will be written to /path/to/folder/output/app/.
- fileName -> this should not include any extension. fileName.hs will depend upon this name.

Note that various other files will also be created.

NOTE: cabal is currently utilized because non-determinism depends on the System.Random package, and cabal is the easiest way we found to quickly deal with this.

### Additional Optional Arguments

Additional arguments are listed below. You must preface them with --

- --max\_iter -> Requires an integer as well. Defaults to 100. This dictates how many iterations Main.hs will execute.

### Utilizing the Generated Files

In /path/to/output/folder/, run

```
cabal run
```

If you wish to change the randomized starting seeds, use 

```
cabal run fileName -- seed1 seed2
```

(seed1 controls the initial seed for the blackboard, while seed2 controls the initial seed for the environment).
